* The Global Superstore is a retail dataset which contains an excel file with three sheets named as 'Orders', 'People' and 'Returns' over 4 years starting from 2012 till 2015 , covering orders of 147 countries around the world.


# PROJECT GOAL
The aim of this project is to analyse the data with respect to the sales and profit after filtering some of the columns.

# PROJECT Motivation

We all use the online global store for shopping , so i m very curious to know that how these superstore works and make profit or loss and also how they make decision to give discount on some products .Thats why i choose this dataset for the analysis.

# ETL TOOl - POWER BI 
I used all the sheets of the excel file to make an insightful and attracting dashboard in the powerful ETL tool - Power BI.

# ‚è≥ Dataset 

Global Superstore dataset has been prepared in excel file with three sheets - Orders, People, Returns
* Orders  - 51290 rows and 25 columns
* People  - 24 rows and 2 columns
* Returns - 1079 rows and 3 columns
