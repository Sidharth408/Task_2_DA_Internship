# PROJECT Motivation

We all use the online global store for shopping , so i m very curious to know that how these superstore works and make profit or loss and also how they make decision to give discount on some products .Thats why i choose this dataset for the analysis.

# ETL TOOl - POWER BI

Global Superstore dataset has been prepared in excel file with three sheets - Orders, People, Returns
* Orders  - 51290 rows and 25 columns
* People  - 24 rows and 2 columns
* Returns - 1079 rows and 3 columns

* Dataset Link -  https://powerbidocs.com/wp-content/up...
* If u check the entries in the dataset , you will see that the store caters to 7 different geographical market segments and 3 major customer segments i.e. 'consumer', 'corporate' and 'Home office'.
